job_type: compute_trajectory

logging:
  level: Log level for the run, one between [DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL].
  file: The path where the program will log. Must be relative to logs/.
        Optional, the default is "logs/$timestamp-$job_type.log".

dynamical_system: the coefficients
  a1: float
  b1: float
  c1: float
  alpha1: float
  beta1: float
  a2: float
  b2: float
  c2: float
  alpha2: float
  beta2: float

trajectory:
  x_0: float. x component of the initial point of the trajectory
  y_0: float. y component of the initial point of the trajectory

trajectory_integration:
  precision: int. Precision of the integration method in units of time, expressed in exp10
             Example: -3 becomes 0.001 units of time.
  limit: float. Upper limit of integration in units of time, the lower limit being 0.
