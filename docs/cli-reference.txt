    COMPUTE

usage: cli.py compute [-h] -j JOB_CONFIG [--job-type JOB_TYPE]
                      [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [--stdout]

run a job according to the parameters declared in a configuration file

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -j JOB_CONFIG, --job-config JOB_CONFIG
                        File where the program should read the job's
                        configuration. Must be a file present in jobs/.
  --job-type JOB_TYPE   Overrides the job type declared in the job
                        configuration file.
  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output-file OUTPUT_FILE
                        File where the program should write the results of the
                        job. Must be relative to results/. Default is
                        "results/$job_type-$timestamp.json".
  --stdout              If set, the program writes its results to standard
                        output.

    VIEW

usage: cli.py view [-h] -i INPUT_FILE [--stdin] [--json]

plot the results of a compute job

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT_FILE, --input-file INPUT_FILE
                        File where the program should read the data to be
                        plotted. Must be a file present in results/.
  --stdin               If set, the program reads the data to be plotted from
                        standard input.
  --json                If set, prints the input file in human readable format
                        instead of plotting.

If the application doesn't detect a display, such as when running inside
Docker or when in an SSH session, the plots are saved in the same directory as
the input file, with the same name and .png extension.
