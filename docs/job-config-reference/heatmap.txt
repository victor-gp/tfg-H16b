job_type: scan_heatmap

logging:
  level: Log level for the run, one between [DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL].
  file: The path where the program will log. Must be relative to logs/.
        Optional, the default is "logs/$timestamp-$job_type.log".

dynamical_system: the coefficients
  a1: float
  b1: float
  c1: float
  alpha1: float
  beta1: float
  a2: float
  b2: float
  c2: float
  alpha2: float
  beta2: float

trajectory_integration:
  precision: int. Precision of the integration method in units of time, expressed in exp10.
             Example: -3 becomes 0.001 units of time.
  limit: float. Upper limit of integration in units of time, the lower limit being 0.

phase_space_scan:
  resolution: int. Distance between two points in the same axis when scanning phase space, in exp10.
              Example: -2 becomes 0.01.
  min_x: float. left boundary of the phase space scan
  max_x: float. right boundary of the phase space scan
  min_y: float. bottom boundary of the phase space scan
  max_y: float. top boundary of the phase space scan

heatmap:
  min_x: float. left boundary of the heatmap
  max_x: float. right boundary of the heatmap
  resolution_x: int. Distance between a cell and the next (horizontal) in the heatmap, in exp10.
  min_y: float. bottom boundary of the heatmap
  max_y: float. top boundary of the heatmap
  resolution_y: int. Distance between a cell and the next (vertical) in the heatmap, in exp10.
